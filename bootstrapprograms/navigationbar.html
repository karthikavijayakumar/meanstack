    Biometrics is a very strong authentication mechanism as it based on something that you are as
opposed to something you know or something you have. Passwords and tokens are highly vulnerable
to being lost or stolen. A weak or compromised password is the primary reason for the rising cases
of security and data breaches. Passwords are the weakest link in an organizations security system and
even strong passwords cannot resist sophisticated hacker attacks. Further, the costs of maintaining
password and token based systems are very high and inefficient. Resetting lost or forgotten passwords
takes up IT support time and reduces employee productivity.
A biometric confirmation is principally an example acknowledgment that empowers an individual ID by deciding the validness of a specific physiological or behavioral characteristics taught by
the client. Outlining a functional and productive methodology for individual distinguishing proof is
an issue that should be tended to. An authentication can be separated into two modules:
a) Enrollment
b) Identification or Verification
The enrollment module is in charge of selecting people into the biometric framework. Amid
the enlistment stage, a biometric per user to deliver a crude computerized representation of the trademark first outputs the biometric normal for a person. So as to encourage coordinating, the crude
advanced representation is generally further prepared by highlight extractor to produce a reduced yet
costly representation, called a format.
Dependent upon the application, the design may be secured in the central datab
